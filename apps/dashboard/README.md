## Key User Flows

### New customer (no flow yet)
1. `/dashboard` → "Create your first flow" empty state
2. Click → `/flows` → template picker shown automatically (4 vertical templates)
3. Pick template → creates flow with all steps pre-filled → redirects to step editor
4. Review / edit steps → back to dashboard → copy embed snippet → paste in product
5. First session appears in activation funnel within minutes

### Existing customer — monitoring
- `/dashboard` — headline metrics + week-over-week deltas (↑↓ arrows) + churn alert banner if users are at risk
- `/activation` — full funnel, steps with >30% drop-off highlighted red, 30-day timeline chart
- `/benchmarks` — activation score ring, stat cards with industry deltas, per-step comparison table

### Improving a lagging step
1. `/benchmarks` shows Step 2 is "poor" (drop-off 2× industry avg)
2. Click "Optimize →" → `/optimize`
3. Click "Optimize with AI" → Claude analyzes sessions → suggests improved prompt
4. Review diff (before / after) + reasoning
5. Click "Apply" → prompt updates live for all future sessions

### At-risk users
1. Red banner on `/dashboard`: "3 users at risk of churning"
2. Click → `/churn` → table sorted by risk score
3. Expand a user → see risk factors + recommended action ("send personalized re-engagement")
4. Filter by Critical / High / Medium

### Handling escalations
1. `/escalations` — inbox shows open tickets sorted by age
2. Click a ticket → `/escalations/[id]` — full context: conversation replay, collected data, user info
3. Add notes, click "Mark in progress" → notify user you're on it
4. Resolve issue externally, click "Resolve" → ticket archived

### Inspecting a specific user
1. `/users` → click any user → side panel opens
2. See all sessions, step-by-step progress, collected data per session
3. Click a step to see timing, message count, AI prompt snapshot

### Enabling auto-optimization
1. `/settings/autooptimize` → toggle "Auto-optimization" on
2. Set threshold (e.g. 50% — optimize steps below this completion rate)
3. Set minSessions (e.g. 10 — wait for enough data first)
4. System scans weekly, applies improved prompts, logs every change
5. View history: optimization log shows before/after diff per step
