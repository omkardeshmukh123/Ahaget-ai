    id: "agent",
    title: "The Agent",
    icon: "🤖",
    body: `The Tesseract Agent is an AI assistant embedded in your product via a lightweight JavaScript widget (~18kb gzipped). It appears as a panel on the side of the user's screen.

The agent is stateful — it knows which flow is active, which step the user is on, and what they've completed. Unlike a chatbot, it maintains complete context across an entire onboarding session, even across page navigations.

The agent can communicate in two modes:
- **Conversational**: Natural language responses to user questions
- **Action**: Direct DOM interactions in the user's live browser`,
  },
  {
    id: "flows",
    title: "Flows",
    icon: "🔀",
    body: `A Flow is a sequence of steps designed to guide a user toward a specific outcome — usually their first meaningful value moment (activation).

You define flows in the Tesseract AI dashboard using a no-code builder. Each flow has:
- A **name** and **description** (visible to the agent, not the user)
- A **trigger condition** (when to start — new users, specific URL, user segment)
- An ordered **list of steps**
- A **completion condition** (what counts as "done")

Flows are versioned. You can publish changes without a code deploy.`,
  },
  {
    id: "steps",
    title: "Steps",
    icon: "📋",
    body: `Steps are the individual units inside a flow. There are four step types:

**Guide step** — the agent talks the user through a concept or action using natural language. No DOM interaction.

**Action step** — the agent directly interacts with the user's UI: fills form fields, clicks buttons, scrolls, highlights elements. Uses the DOM action engine (8 self-healing selector strategies).

**Smart question** — the agent asks the user a question and uses their answer to personalize subsequent steps (e.g., "What's your primary use case?").

**Verification step** — the agent checks a condition before proceeding: URL match, element visible, API response, or user confirmation.`,
  },
  {
    id: "mtu",
    title: "MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)",
    icon: "📊",
    body: `MTU stands for Monthly Tracked User. One MTU = one unique user who interacts with a Tesseract AI-powered flow in a given calendar month.

A user counts as one MTU regardless of how many flows they complete or how many sessions they have that month.

Users are identified via the \`userId\` field in your TesseractConfig. If no userId is set, Tesseract AI uses a cookie-based anonymous ID (this still counts as an MTU).

Your plan limits define how many MTUs you can track per month. The free tier includes 100 MTU.`,
  },
  {
    id: "dom-engine",
    title: "DOM Action Engine",
    icon: "⚡",
    body: `When the agent needs to interact with your UI, it uses the DOM Action Engine — a selector-based system that can find and interact with elements reliably.

The engine uses 8 sequential fallback strategies to locate elements, in order of reliability:
1. data-Tesseract AI-id attribute (most reliable — add to elements you want targetable)
2. data-testid attribute
3. aria-label
4. CSS class + text content combination
5. XPath
6. Position-based fallback
7. Visual similarity matching
8. AI-generated selector (last resort)

This means a UI redesign that changes class names won't break your flows — the engine falls through to the next strategy.`,
  },
  {
    id: "failure-inbox",
    title: "Failure Inbox",
    icon: "📬",
    body: `The Failure Inbox captures every session where a user got stuck, dropped off, or triggered a human escalation.

For each failed session, you can see:
- The complete conversation transcript between agent and user
- Which step the failure occurred on
- What the agent said immediately before the user left
- The time spent on each step
- A one-click button to edit the agent's prompt for that specific step

This closes the feedback loop: you see exactly what broke, exactly where, and you can fix it without a code deploy.`,
  },
  {
    id: "mcp",
    title: "MCP Connectors",
    icon: "🔌",
    body: `MCP (Model Context Protocol) connectors let the agent take real actions in your backend during onboarding — not just in the UI.

Examples:
- Check if a user's integration is live (GET /api/integrations/:id → check status)
- Create a starter resource on their behalf (POST /api/projects → seed project)
- Verify credentials (POST /api/auth/verify → confirm API key)

You configure connectors in the dashboard by providing an endpoint URL, method, and auth headers. The agent decides when to call them based on its system prompt.`,
